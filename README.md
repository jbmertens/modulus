# Astrophysics-Informed Machine Learning

### Modulus Tests

This repository mainly contains scratch work and testing for solving equations using NVIDIA [Modulus](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus). These are basic assessments of how relevant physics-informed nets might be for cosmological applications, including looking at self-gravitating matter (including modifications to general relativity) and cosmology. 

The answer: it's looking interesting!
