### Modulus Tests

This repository mostly contains scratch work for PDE solving using NVIDIA's [Modulus](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus). These are just some basic assessments of how relevant physics-informed nets (Modulus in particular) might be for studying cosmological systems, including self-gravitating matter and modifications to general relativity. It's looking interesting! More work forthcoming.
